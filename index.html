                            also known by the initialism SRK, is an Indian actor and film producer who works in Hindi
                            cinema. Referred to in the media as the "Baadshah of Bollywood" and "King Khan",[b] he has
                            appeared in more than 100 films, and earned numerous accolades, including 14 Filmfare
                            Awards. He has been awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India, as well as the Order
                            of Arts and Letters and Legion of Honour by the Government of France. Khan has a significant
                            following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide. In terms of audience size and income,
                            several media outlets have described him as one of the most successful film stars in the
                            world.[c] Many of his films thematise Indian national identity and connections with diaspora
                            communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and grievances.

                            Khan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s and
                            made his Bollywood debut in 1992 with the musical romance Deewana. He was initially
                            recognised for playing villainous roles in the films Baazigar (1993) and Darr (1993). Khan
                            established himself by starring in a series of top-grossing romantic films, including
                            Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998),
                            Mohabbatein (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Veer-Zaara
                            (2004) and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of an
                            alcoholic in the period romantic drama Devdas (2002), a NASA scientist in the social drama
                            Swades (2004), a hockey coach in the sports drama Chak De! India (2007), and a man with
                            Asperger syndrome in the drama My Name Is Khan (2010). Further commercial successes came
                            with the romances Om Shanti Om (2007) and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), and with his expansion
                            to comedies in Chennai Express (2013) and Happy New Year (2014). Following a brief setback
                            and hiatus, Khan made a career comeback with the 2023 action thrillers Pathaan and Jawan,
                            both of which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films.

                            Srivastava;[1] 11 October 1942[7]) is an Indian actor who works in Hindi cinema. He is often
                            considered one of the greatest, most accomplished and commercially successful actors in the
                            history of Indian cinema.[8] With a cinematic career spanning over five decades, he has
                            played pivotal roles in over 200 films. Bachchan is often hailed as the Shahenshah of
                            Bollywood, Sadi Ke Mahanayak (translated as "Greatest actor of the century" in Hindi), Star
                            of the Millennium, or simply Big B.[9] His dominance in the Indian film industry during the
                            1970s–80s led the French director François Truffaut to describe it as a "one-man
                            industry".[10] He is a recipient of several accolades including six National Film Awards and
                            sixteen Filmfare Awards.

                            Amitabh Bachchan was born in 1942 in Allahabad (now Prayagraj) to the Hindi poet Harivansh
                            Rai Bachchan and his wife, the social activist Teji Bachchan. He was educated at Sherwood
                            College, Nainital, and Kirori Mal College, University of Delhi. His film career started in
                            1969 as a voice narrator in Mrinal Sen's film Bhuvan Shome. He first gained popularity in
                            the early-1970s for films, such as Anand, Zanjeer and Roti Kapada Aur Makaan, and achieved
                            greater stardom in later years, being dubbed India's "Angry Young Man" for several of his
                            on-screen roles in Hindi films.[11][12] He consistently starred in top–grossing Indian films
                            from the mid-1970s to the 1980s, such as Deewaar, Sholay, Kabhi Kabhie, Hera Pheri, Amar

                            Raasta and Agneepath.[15][16] After taking a break from acting in the 1990s, his resurgence
                            was marked in 2000 with Mohabbatein.[17] Since then he starred in several successful and
                            acclaimed films like Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, Aankhen, Baghban, Khakee, Black, Bunty Aur

                            Brahmāstra: Part One – Shiva and Kalki 2898 AD.[18] For Piku, he won his fourth National
                            Film Award for Best Actor, making him the only actor to do so. Bachchan also made an
                            appearance in a Hollywood film, The Great Gatsby (2013), in which he played a non-Indian
                            Jewish character.

                            Indian actor who works in Hindi cinema. He has portrayed a variety of characters and is
                            known for his dancing skills. One of the highest-paid actors in India, he has won many
                            awards, including six Filmfare Awards, of which four were for Best Actor. Starting from
                            2012, he has appeared in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 several times based on his income and
                            popularity.

                            Roshan has frequently collaborated with his father, Rakesh Roshan. He made brief appearances
                            as a child actor in several films in the 1980s and later worked as an assistant director on
                            four of his father's films. His first leading role was in the box-office success Kaho Naa...
                            Pyaar Hai (2000), for which he received several awards. Performances in the 2000 terrorism
                            drama Fiza and the 2001 ensemble family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... consolidated his
                            reputation but were followed by several poorly received films.

                            The 2003 science fiction film Koi... Mil Gaya, for which Roshan won two Filmfare Awards, was
                            a turning point in his film career; he later starred as the titular superhero in its
                            sequels: Krrish (2006) and Krrish 3 (2013). He earned praise for his portrayal of a thief in
                            Dhoom 2 (2006), Mughal emperor Akbar in Jodhaa Akbar (2008) and a quadriplegic in Guzaarish
                            (2010). He achieved further commercial success with the comedy-drama Zindagi Na Milegi
                            Dobara (2011), the revenge drama Agneepath (2012), the biopic Super 30 (2019), and action

                        <div class="col-sm-12">Abdul Rashid Salim Salman Khan (pronounced [səlˈmɑːn xɑːn]; born 27
                            December 1965)[3] is an Indian actor, film producer, and television personality who
                            predominantly works in Hindi films. In a career spanning over three decades, Khan has
                            received numerous awards, including two National Film Awards as a film producer, and two
                            Filmfare Awards as an actor.[4] He is cited in the media as one of the most commercially
                            successful actors of Indian cinema.[5][6] Forbes has included Khan in listings of the
                            highest-paid celebrities in the world, in 2015 and 2018, with him being the highest-ranked
                            Indian in the latter year.[7][8][9][10] Khan has starred in the annual highest-grossing
                            Hindi film of 10 individual years, the highest for any actor.[11]

                            Khan began his acting career with a supporting role in Biwi Ho To Aisi (1988), followed by
                            his breakthrough with a leading role in Sooraj Barjatya's romantic drama Maine Pyar Kiya
                            (1989), for which he was awarded the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. He established
                            himself with several commercially successful films, including Barjatya's family dramas Hum
                            Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994) and Hum Saath-Saath Hain (1999), the action film Karan Arjun
                            (1995) and the comedy Biwi No.1 (1999). After a period of fluctuations, Khan resurrected his
                            screen image with the action film Wanted (2009), and achieved greater stardom by starring in
                            the top-grossing action films Dabangg (2010), Ready (2011), Bodyguard (2011), Ek Tha Tiger
                            (2012), Dabangg 2 (2012), Kick (2014), and Tiger Zinda Hai (2017), and the dramas Bajrangi
                            Bhaijaan (2015) and Sultan (2016). This was followed by a series of poorly-received films,
                            with the exception of the sequel Tiger 3 (2023).
